problem faced

problem 1

The error "Unreachable code detected" occurs because the code after the return statement is never executed. In JavaScript, when a return statement is encountered within a function, the function execution immediately stops, and the specified value is returned.
The return statements were inside the if and else blocks, which meant the function would immediately exit after either condition was met, preventing the console.log from running.
